Overview
Welcome to our project! This repository showcases a collection of features designed to enhance performance, usability, and real-time interaction. Here’s a breakdown of what you’ll find:

Features

1. Performance Optimization
   Debouncing for Improved Efficiency:
   Without Debouncing: Handling each input immediately can result in high performance costs. For example, with 14 letters, the performance overhead can be as high as 14 _ 1000 = 14,000 operations.
   With Debouncing: Implementing debouncing reduces the operation count to 3 _ 1000 = 3,000 by delaying processing until input stabilizes. This significantly boosts efficiency and responsiveness.

2. N-Level Nested Comments (REDDIT Style)
   Hierarchical Comment System:
   Our implementation supports multiple levels of nested comments, similar to Reddit’s structure. This feature allows users to engage in detailed discussions with a clear, threaded view of conversations.
3. Live Chat Integration
   Real-Time Communication:
   WebSockets: Provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, ideal for real-time chat applications.
   API Polling: An alternative method where the client periodically checks for updates from the server, suitable for less frequent interactions.
4. Search Suggestions with Debouncing
   Enhanced Search Experience:
   Implementing debouncing in search suggestions helps in providing relevant results while reducing the number of API calls. This improves user experience by avoiding unnecessary queries and ensuring faster response times.
